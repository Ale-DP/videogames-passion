Videogames Passion was born while playing online, and I thought would have been much better to have a reliable group of players with same passion in common.
Too many times, unless you plan an online match with you friends, matchmaking assign you someone from all around the world, but sometimes those people might cheat or drop you the game. 
And this is annoying and frustrating, so imagine if you can count on a group of reliable people that just want to play and have fun.

The purpose of Videogames Passion is to know people, share interests, favourite games and plan together games online, to limit the risk to be matched casually with someone with different intent.
